      <description>As a hobby, I develop videogames, and I&amp;rsquo;ve released two so far:
Tengam Reproduction Man I am inordinately fond of both the Kotlin programming language and command-line utilities. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a few Kotlin-based utilities that I use pretty much every day:
kinstall - a utility to manage gradle-project-based command-line utilities. tnote - a command-line note taking app. glasnik - a command-line REST client (like Postman but with no GUI). I spend more time than is advisable playing a videogame called Noita.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer and architect with a focus in the last 7 years on data engineering.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a variety of industries, including transportation, energy, videoconferencing, occupational health and human resources. I&amp;rsquo;ve also done work in the criminal justice non-profit space. You can download my resum√© here.
I studied Philosophy in college, which has served me surprisingly well in software design and engineering. My philosophical interests center around cognition, language, complexity, Pragmatism, and the nature of mental concepts &amp;ndash; all of which relate directly to the central problem of complexity in software devolpment.</description>
