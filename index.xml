      <description>As a hobby, I develop videogames, and I&amp;rsquo;ve released two so far:
Tengam Reproduction Man I am inordinately fond of both the Kotlin programming language and command-line utilities. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a few Kotlin-based utilities that I use pretty much every day:
kinstall - a utility to manage gradle-project-based command-line utilities. tnote - a command-line note taking app. glasnik - a command-line REST client (like Postman but with no GUI). I spend more time than is advisable playing a videogame called Noita.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer and architect with a focus in the last 7 years on data engineering.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a variety of industries, including transportation, energy, videoconferencing, occupational health and human resources. I&amp;rsquo;ve also done work in the criminal justice non-profit space. You can download my resum√© here.
I have been programming computers for a long time (my first computer was a TRS-80 Model I), but since my AP CompSci class in high school (Pascal on a Commodore SuperPET), I haven&amp;rsquo;t received any formal education in Computer Science.</description>
