    <p>I am a software engineer and architect with a focus in the last 7 years on data engineering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in a variety of industries, including transportation, energy, videoconferencing, occupational health and human resources. I&rsquo;ve also done work in the criminal justice non-profit space. You can <a href="/docs/david-kilmer-resume.pdf">download my resumé here</a>.</p>
<p>I have been programming computers for a long time (my first computer was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80 Model I</a>), but since my AP CompSci class in high school (Pascal on a Commodore SuperPET), I haven&rsquo;t received any formal education in Computer Science. I studied Philosophy in college, which has served me well, apart from the fact that I&rsquo;m too philosophical about everything &ndash; which isn&rsquo;t really college&rsquo;s fault.</p>
